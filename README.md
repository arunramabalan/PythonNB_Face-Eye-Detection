# Python Face Eye Detection Jupyter Notebook

Face Eye Detection using Python Notebook,

Hi Everyone, Herewith I have updated the steps to Create Face Eye Detection.

Step 1: Connect the Webcam into your system and Verify this is working perfectly. 

Step 2: "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml, haarcascade_eye.xml" copy and paste this files into your Notebook folder where you wants to run and execute the Python 

Step 3: Use the "Face Eye Detection.ipynb" file and run this. It will open the window and load the webcam. Here you can show your Face & Eye, it will detect.

Note: Here we can detect multiple Faces, Eyes too.


Thank you
